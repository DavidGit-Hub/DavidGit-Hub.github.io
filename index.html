                   <h2>Why did we make this website?</h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">We want to improve the hard and stressful process of purchasing a car by helping people make informed and right decisions when it comes to buying a car. To do so, our model will take the userâ€™s input on specific car characteristics and predict a selling price based on the given information, this allows consumers to buy a suitable car for themselves that is also within their budget. </p>

                               <h2>Cleaning Data Process</h2>
                      <p class="mb-0"> By receiving advice from experienced coders and some trial and error when scanning through our data, the team was able to identify and correct data that was unclear, unnecessary, and negatively impacted our project. Cleaning our data was necessary for the success of our project because the raw untouched data contained incorrect and missing rows of data which can lead to many inaccuracies when turned into a model. By cleaning our data, we can prevent these errors from occurring, therefore making our model present accurate information instead.    </p>

                       <h2>Removing Outliers</h2>
                      <p class="mb-0">In our scatter plot in which we input two variables that might show correlation there unfortunately was some numbers that skewed our results and just made the graph unappealing. Since these outliers are highly unnecessary due to them having a high probability of being an error and also making the graph look less aesthetically pleasing, we removed any values that were abnormal compared to a specific amount. </p>

                        <p class="mb-0"> We made use of a used car dataset and a library that helped us train the AI in making as correct a prediction as possible. We used many graphs and charts to visualize the data we have collected. </p>

The second scatter plot displays the relationship between the car's selling price and its max power.

The lines inside each of the boxes represent the median of where the prices usually fall under for each brand. The lines extending from the boxes represent the remaining data, and the dots outside of the boxes represent the outliers outside of the remaining data.</p>

                      <h2 id = "machine learning"> Regression Modeling: </h2>
                      <p class="mb-0">  The regression model helps us understand how our AI will predict where the prices will go in accordance to our data. It gives the AI the proper correlation and predictions. The scatter plot is the result of the machine learning algorithm. It compared max power to selling price. The split we used was an 80 to 20 split. In our regression models, we used a couple different methods to measure our data. We used mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The MAE is the average value of difference between the predicted answer and the correct answer. The MSE is the amount of error in the model. The RMSE is the standard deviation of the data points. In our models the numbers are inflated due to the dataset having large numbers for datapoints. </p>
                      <br>
                    <h4> Linear Regression </h4>
                    <p class="mb-0">  For the linear regression model, we got a mean absolute error of 67592.601, mean squared error of 3706721585.309, and a root mean squared error of 60882.851. </p>

                    <h4> Ridge Regression </h4>
                    <p class="mb-0"> For the ridge regression model, we got a mean absolute value of 67592.597, mean squared error of 3706721775.944, and a root mean squared error of 60882.853. </p>

                    <h4> Decision Tree </h4>
                    <p class="mb-0"> For the decision tree model, we got a mean absolute value of 15104.545, mean squared error of 905637828.458, and a root mean squared error of 30093.817. This turned out to be the best model we made. </p>

                      <h2> Classification Modeling: </h2>
                      <p class="mb-0">  This type of model will attempt to draw a conclusion from our inputs from the Used Car Dataset that we have chosen. This essentially gives the AI values to understand and train under. This form of modeling can only accept things that are ultimately defined such as True or False, or if a car is sold or not sold. In the end, our classification models did not do too well. For example, for our SVC, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression models, the accuracy scores were about 50% accurate. </p>
                    <br>

                      <p class="mb-0">  This chart shows our results from our machine learning algorithm. The boxes each have their own individual use. The top left is true positive and the bottom right is true negative. These are the boxes we want the numbers in. Each number is a data point that the algorithm got correct. The other boxes are the number of wrong data points. this is where we want to have the least amount of numbers. </p>
                      <br>
                      <h2> Results and Conclusion: </h2>
                      <p class="mb-0">  From our regression modeling and predicting car prices, we found that the decision tree was the best model, obtaining the lowest MSE, MAE, and RMSE. While testing our classification modeling to predict whether a car was sold or not, we found that the models were not very effective as they only had accuracy scores of 50%. In full honesty, we had a great time making this and we have learned quite a lot from this experience. I hope that you will as well with our inference towards car prices to help further our own understanding of AI. To help others understand what they are going to buy our product is great to help since people sometimes wish for an easier way to find a car that is right for them. </p>

                    <br>
                      <h2> Why does this matter: </h2>
                      <p class="mb-0">  This project can help people who need a used car for a good price. The car model shows how much each type of car would usually cost depending on the cars state at the time. It can fit the individual's specific needs and can help people in their own specific situation. </p>
